<!--	About St. Louis		-->
<p>
	St. Louis is the second-largest city in Missouri. 
	It sits near the confluence of the Mississippi and the 
	Missouri Rivers. In 2020, the city proper had a 
	population of 301,578, while the bi-state metropolitan 
	area, which extends into Illinois, had an estimated 
	population of over 2.8 million, making it the largest 
	metropolitan area in Missouri, the second-largest in 
	Illinois, and the 20th-largest in the United States.
</p>
<p>
	Before European settlement, the area was a regional 
	center of Native American Mississippian culture. 
	St. Louis was founded on February 14, 1764, by French 
	fur traders Gilbert Antoine de St. Maxent, Pierre Laclède 
	and Auguste Chouteau, who named it for Louis IX of France. 
	In 1764, following France's defeat in the Seven Years' War, 
	the area was ceded to Spain. In 1800, it was retroceded to 
	France, which sold it three years later to the United 
	States as part of the Louisiana Purchase; the city was 
	then the point of embarkation for the Corps of Discovery on 
	the Lewis and Clark Expedition. In the 19th century, St.
	Louis became a major port on the Mississippi River; from 
	1870 until the 1920 census, it was the fourth-largest city 
	in the country. It separated from St. Louis County in 1877, 
	becoming an independent city and limiting its political 
	boundaries. In 1904, it hosted the Louisiana Purchase 
	Exposition and the Summer Olympics.
</p>
<p>
	A "Gamma" global city with a metropolitan GDP of more 
	than $160 billion in 2017, metropolitan St. Louis has 
	a diverse economy with strengths in the service, manufacturing,
	trade, transportation, and tourism industries. It is home to 
	eight Fortune 500 companies. Major companies headquartered or 
	with significant operations in the city include Ameren 
	Corporation, Peabody Energy, Nestlé Purina PetCare, Anheuser-Busch, 
	Wells Fargo Advisors, Stifel Financial, Spire, Inc., 
	MilliporeSigma, FleishmanHillard, Square, Inc., U.S. Bank, 
	Anthem BlueCross and Blue Shield, Federal Reserve Bank of 
	St. Louis, U.S. Department of Agriculture, National 
	Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Centene Corporation, and 
	Express Scripts.
	</p>
<p>
	Major research universities include Saint Louis University and 
	Washington University in St. Louis. The Washington University 
	Medical Center in the Central West End neighborhood hosts an 
	agglomeration of medical and pharmaceutical institutions, 
	including Barnes-Jewish Hospital.
